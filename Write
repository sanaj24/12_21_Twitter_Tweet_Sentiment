1. At the top, please list your first name, last name, and your email address. 2. Indicate whether you chose to do a classification or regression task and why. 
3. Explain any data preprocessing you tried and used. If you used an external word embedding model to preprocess your tweets, please provide a name and refer ence to it. 
4. What were the features (post preprocessing) you trained the machine learning model on, and what were the targets (post preprocessing)? Please list the fea ture names, domain, and type in a table (similar to the one we provided in the Dataset section. 
5. Indicate the type of machine learning model you used and any hyperparameters you adjusted or specified. If you used a neural network, please list the input, hidden, and output layers you used with their respective sizes and activation functions. Why did you settle on this model/architecture? What were the steps that led you to it? 
6. If applicable, indicate the loss and optimizer for your machine learning model. 7. How did you split the training, validation (if applicable), and test data? 
8. What evaluation metrics did you use to evaluate your model? What were your results?
